# Twitter-Sentiment140-Analysis
Binary classification of sentiment140 data set using LSTM neural network.<br/>


The code classifies the text based on having positive or negative sentiment.<br/>
The code consits of three major parts:<br/>
* Data pre-processing (Exploring, Cleaning, Tokenization, Lemmatization)
* Defining a costum embedding layer (using GloVe embedding)
* Creating a model, training the model and optimizing it.<br/>

The final product gives out predictions such as this:<br/>

where numbers close to 1 indicate a positive statement and numbers closer to 0 indicate the opposite.


Further explenation is given in the notebook on each part.
